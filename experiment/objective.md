## Objective

**PCR** is a technique utilized to make multiple copies of a specific DNA sequence *in vitro*. The  PCR reaction is repeatedly cycled through a series of temperature changes, which allow many copies of the target DNA sequence to be produced. PCR has a wide variety of applications in the field of
biotechnology and biomedical research. It is routinely used for DNA cloning, mutagenesis, medical diagnostics, agricultural testing, and forensic analysis of DNA.
