<b> Experiment|     <b> DNA amplification by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and experiment number 2



### About the Experiment 

PCR is a technique utilized to make multiple copies of a specific DNA sequence in vitro. The  PCR reaction is repeatedly cycled through a series of temperature changes, which allow many copies of the target DNA sequence to be produced. PCR has many research and practical applications. It is routinely used for DNA cloning, mutagenesis, medical diagnostics, agricultural testing, and forensic analysis of DNA.
